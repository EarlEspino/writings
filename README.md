Once upon a time, there was a boy. The boy liked to use GitHub, and he likes to post things on Github. He has a few repositories, and most of them are unfinished projects because he is kind of lazy. But in his defense, some of his code is kind of cool. 
Aside from GitHub, he is pretty much a every day lurker on reddit.
